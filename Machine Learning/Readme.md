# Mobile Phone Price Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the price of mobile phones using logistic regression and decision tree algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset specifically curated for mobile phone price prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is a collection of various features and specifications of mobile phones, such as battery power, camera megapixels, RAM, etc. It also includes the corresponding price of each phone. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure high-quality input for the model.

## Algorithms
Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm used for predicting binary outcomes or multiple discrete outcomes. In the context of this project, it is used for classifying mobile phones into different price ranges. The logistic regression model learns the relationships between the input features and the price categories, enabling it to make predictions on unseen data.

## Decision Tree
A decision tree is a tree-like flowchart structure used for making decisions or predictions. In this project, the decision tree algorithm is employed for classifying mobile phones into different price ranges. The decision tree learns a series of rules based on the features of the input data and constructs a tree-like model. It then uses this model to predict the price category of a given mobile phone.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The machine learning model is trained using a combination of logistic regression and decision tree algorithms. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's performance.
